# Contributing

We welcome pull requests on fixes, documentation updates, and even features. Ideally changes are discrete, documented inline with current standards, and don't contain superficial changes like tab formatting an entire file (hard to accept a PR that has 1000 changes). Don't commit updates to the `dist/` folder, as those will be done by the maintainers at our discretion.

### Pull Requests

Our continuous integration processes will lint and test all pull requests. To save time, please lint and test your changes locally, prior to committing.

Please reference any issues that your PR addresses.

### Local Development
