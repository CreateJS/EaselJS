Version NEXT [Not Released]
****************************************************************************************************
CRITICAL (may break existing content):
- modified behaviour of SpriteSheetBuilder.addFrame setupFunction, setupParams & setupScope params
- removed the deprecated mousemove & mouseup events on MouseEvent
- removed Graphics.inject() in favour of Graphics.append()
- Sprite now properly displays the first frame of animations after calling gotoAndPlay() (thanks MannyC)
- Moved Ticker into the "createjs" package since it will be included with TweenJS in future releases.
- re-architected the class and inheritance model
	- initialize methods removed, use SuperClass_constructor instead
	- helper methods: extend & promote (see the "Utility Methods" docs)
	- property definitions are now instance level, and in the constructor (performance gains)
	- the .constructor is now set correctly on all classes (thanks kaesve)
	- renamed initialize on geom classes to "setValues()"
- removed secondary properties (visible, alpha, compositeOperation, shadow) and related functionality from Matrix2D
	- added DisplayProps to hold these properties + a matrix instance
- Matrix2D append/prepend naming was reversed. It was previously backwards from a math perspective.

***********
PERFORMANCE:
- added performance tests to extras
- significant performance improvements:
	- vector graphics (especially in Graphics instance with large numbers of instructions)
	- filters (thanks pfirpfel) (~2-4x faster)
	- overall display list performance (~2x faster)
	- display object property access (~2x faster)
	- tick event propagation (~3x faster)
