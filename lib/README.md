# lib directory
This directory contains compressed versions of the EaselJS library, including the most recent tagged release and the in-progress NEXT release.

Both combined and minified versions of the library are included. The former being useful for debugging, and the latter for deployment.

You can also link to the libraries on the [CreateJS CDN](http://code.createjs.com/), to benefit from faster load times and shared caching across sites.


# libraries
**easeljs-VERSION.min.js** contains minified versions of all of the EaselJS classes (comments and white space stripped) except the contents of easeljs/filters and easeljs/display/MovieClip.

**movieclip-VERSION.min.js** contains a minified version of the MovieClip class. This class is not commonly used for hand-coded projects so it is packaged separately.


# license
The libraries are Â©2010 gskinner.com, inc., and made available under the highly permissive MIT open source software license. See the source file header for the full license text.
