/**

/**
 * Promotes any methods on the super class that were overridden, by creating an alias in the format `prefix_methodName`.
 * It is recommended to use the super class's name as the prefix.
 * An alias to the super class's constructor is always added in the format `prefix_constructor`.
 * This allows the subclass to call super class methods without using `function.call`, providing better performance.
 * 
 * For example, if `MySubClass` extends `MySuperClass`, and both define a `draw` method, then calling `promote(MySubClass, "MySuperClass")`
 * would add a `MySuperClass_constructor` method to MySubClass and promote the `draw` method on `MySuperClass` to the
 * prototype of `MySubClass` as `MySuperClass_draw`.
 * 
 * This should be called after the class's prototype is fully defined.
 * 
 * 	function ClassA(name) {
 * 		this.name = name;
 * 	}
 * 	ClassA.prototype.greet = function() {
 * 		return "Hello "+this.name;
 * 	}
 * 	
 * 	function ClassB(name, punctuation) {
 * 		this.ClassA_constructor(name);
 * 		this.punctuation = punctuation;	
 * 	}
 * 	createjs.extend(ClassB, ClassA);
 * 	ClassB.prototype.greet = function() {
 * 		return this.ClassA_greet()+this.punctuation;
 * 	}
 * 	createjs.promote(ClassB, "ClassA");
 * 	
 * 	var foo = new ClassB("World", "!?!");
 * 	console.log(foo.greet()); // Hello World!?!
 * 
 * @method promote
 * @param {Function} subclass The class to promote super class methods on.
 * @param {String} prefix The prefix to add to the promoted method names. Usually the name of the superclass.
 * @return {Function} Returns the subclass.
