/**
* Encapsulates the properties associated with a sprite sheet. A sprite sheet is a series of images (usually animation frames) combined
* into a single image on a regular grid. For example, an animation consisting of 8 100x100 images could be combined into a 400x200
* sprite sheet (4 frames across by 2 high).
* The simplest form of sprite sheet has values for the image, frameWidth, and frameHeight properties, but does not include frameData.
* It will then play all of the frames in the animation and loop if the loop property is true. In this simple mode, you can also set
* the totalFrames property if you have extraneous frames in your sprite sheet (for example, a 2x4 frame sprite sheet, with only 7
* frames used).<br/><br/>
* More complex sprite sheets include a frameData property, which provides named frames and animations which can be played and sequenced
* together. See frameData for more information.
* @class SpriteSheet
* @constructor
* @param {Image | HTMLCanvasElement | HTMLVideoElement | String} imageOrUri The Image, Canvas, or Video instance or URI to an image to use as a sprite sheet.
* @param {Number} frameWidth The width in pixels of each frame on the sprite sheet.
* @param {Number} frameHeight The height in pixels of each frame on the sprite sheet.
* @param {Object} frameData Defines named frames and frame sequences. See the frameData property for more information.
