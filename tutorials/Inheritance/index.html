				<h2>Inheritance</h2>
			</header>
			<p>
				Creating new class definitions that extend existing display objects provides encapsulated, easily reusable visual elements, and it's easy to do. This tutorial shows one method of extending a class, but there are many other options - use the one that's most comfortable for you, but apply the lessons you learn here.
			</p>
			<p>
				We'll create a <code>Button</code> class, that extends <code>Container</code>.
			</p>
			<textarea class="brush: js;" readonly>
(function() {

function Button(label) {
	this.Container_constructor();
	this.label = label;
}
var p = createjs.extend(Button, createjs.Container);

p.draw = function() {
	this.Container_draw();
	// add custom logic here.
}

window.Button = createjs.promote(Button, "Container");
}());
			</textarea>
			<p>
				Lines 1 & 15 create an anonymous function scope to work in and avoid polluting the global scope.
			</p>
			<h3>The constructor</h3>
			<p>
				Line 3 defines the constructor function which will be called when we create new Button instances.
				Line 4 calls Container's constructor, via a method alias that was set up by <code>promote</code> (more on that shortly).
				Calling the super class's constructor is very important to ensure new instances are set up correctly.
				Line 5 just sets the value of an instance property based on a parameter passed to the constructor.
			</p>
			<h3>Using createjs.extend()</h3>
			<p>
				Line 7 makes Button extend, or inherit from, the Container class. This adds Container to it's prototype
				chain, making all of its methods available in Button.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <code>extend</code> method passes back the
				new prototype, which we assign to a new variable <code>p</code> for easy access.
			</p>
			<h3>Adding methods</h3>
			<p>
				Lines 9-12 set up a new draw method on Button's prototype, which overrides an existing draw method on Container. Just like with the
				constructor, it can call its super class's version of the method using a special method that was added by <code>promote</code>.
			</p>
			<h3>Using createjs.promote()</h3>
			<p>
				Line 14 calls <code>promote</code>, which identifies all of the methods in Container that were overridden in Button
				(including the constructor) and promotes them into Button with a new name in the format <code>prefix_methodName</code>.
				We specified "Container" as the prefix which results in promoted methods that look like <code>Container_draw</code>.
				This gives you an easy and highly performant way to call super class methods in the instance scope.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <code>promote</code> method returns the class, which is then assigned into the global/window scope to make it available for our application.
			</p>

				<h2>Finishing up</h2>
			</header>
			<p>
				Now the class can be instantiated, and added to the display list like any other display object.
			</p>
			<textarea class="brush: js;" readonly>
var myButton = new Button("label");
stage.addChild(myButton);
			</textarea>
			<p>
				Check out demo.html and Button.js to see an example of this in action. Click the buttons.
